#finish making individual variables like euler pitch
#get rid of things i don't need from this
#make 3 tkinter balls
#hook up glow balls to ring values
#find out ranges of everything that ring can output
#hook up each thing to color ranges so i can easily try out different combinations

right now work is being down in run_threads

each ball should have it's own var
	when we get a new set of ring variables, we update each balls_var based on what its connected to
ball dict should have ip and current current ring_var


hook up different colors
allow for opposites
color cheange on thresholds
gradual color changes

toe
tapping could skip to next color
maybe double tap or side tap could enter some sort of color slider thing
sequences could be set up that colors cycle through with every tap

click
flat foot tap
toe down tap
side flick (either direction)
