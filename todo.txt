move run_threads to main directory and call it main
#get rid of things i don't need from this
#make 3 tkinter balls
#hook up glow balls to ring values
#find out ranges of everything that ring can output
#hook up each thing to color ranges so i can easily try out different combinations

right now work is being down in run_threads
